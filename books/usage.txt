no author is given, all authors and their books will be printed.

[--filter_year -y startYearInt [endYearInt]]
Given a range of years A to B, filter out book titles that are not published
between years A and B, inclusive. Default filter year is all years. If one year

We also feature flag-combining

[--filter_title --filter_author -ta "titleString" "authorString"]
Given two filter strings T and S separated by double quotations, filter out all
books whose titles do not contain T and filter out all authors whose names do
not contain S. Print out all books that satisfy both conditions.

[--filter_title --filter_year -ta "titleString" "startYearInt [endYearInt]"]
Given one filter strings S and one year range T separated by double quotations,
filter out all books whose titles do not contain S and all books not published
within year range T. Print out all books that satisfy both conditions.

If no argument is given, a message will be sent reading "one positional argument
is required, please include at least one filter."
